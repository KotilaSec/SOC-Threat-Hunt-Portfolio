## New Series: Studying MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

This is a new series focused on studying MITRE ATT&CK techniques through the lens of a SOC analyst.  

Each challenge highlights a real attack technique with short research prompts, a hands-on lab simulation, and basic detection exercises. You can go as deep as you’d like — these notes become your personal reference for real-world scenarios.  

### The goal is to build skills step by step:
- **Understand** what the technique is and why attackers use it  
- **Safely simulate** it in a lab  
- **Detect** it with real telemetry and KQL  
- **Share** and compare findings with the community
