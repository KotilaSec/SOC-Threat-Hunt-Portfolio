# First MITRE ATT&CK Community Challenge

New series to study MITRE ATT&CK techniques the way a SOC analyst would. Each challenge focuses on one real attack technique with short research questions, a hands-on lab simulation, and simple detection work. You can go as deep and detailed as you like. These will be your notes and can be used for reference later in a real world setting.

The goal is to build your skills step-by-step:
- Learn what the technique is and why attackers use it
- Simulate it in a safe lab
- Detect it using real telemetry and KQL
- Share and compare your findings with the community
